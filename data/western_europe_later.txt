Exploiting poor American naval command decisions, the German navy ravaged Allied shipping off the American Atlantic coast.[190] By November 1941, Commonwealth forces had launched a counter-offensive, Operation Crusader, in North Africa, and reclaimed all the gains the Germans and Italians had made.[191] In North Africa, the Germans launched an offensive in January, pushing the British back to positions at the Gazala Line by early February,[192] followed by a temporary lull in combat which Germany used to prepare for their upcoming offensives.[193] Concerns the Japanese might use bases in Vichy-held Madagascar caused the British to invade the island in early May 1942.[194] An Axis offensive in Libya forced an Allied retreat deep inside Egypt until Axis forces were stopped at El Alamein.[195] On the Continent, raids of Allied commandos on strategic targets, culminating in the disastrous Dieppe Raid,[196] demonstrated the Western Allies' inability to launch an invasion of continental Europe without much better preparation, equipment, and operational security.[197]

In August 1942, the Allies succeeded in repelling a second attack against El Alamein[198] and, at a high cost, managed to deliver desperately needed supplies to the besieged Malta.[199] A few months later, the Allies commenced an attack of their own in Egypt, dislodging the Axis forces and beginning a drive west across Libya.[200] This attack was followed up shortly after by Anglo-American landings in French North Africa, which resulted in the region joining the Allies.[201] Hitler responded to the French colony's defection by ordering the occupation of Vichy France;[201] although Vichy forces did not resist this violation of the armistice, they managed to scuttle their fleet to prevent its capture by German forces.[202] The now pincered Axis forces in Africa withdrew into Tunisia, which was conquered by the Allies in May 1943.[203]

In early 1943 the British and Americans began the "Combined Bomber Offensive", a strategic bombing campaign against Germany. The goals were to disrupt the German war economy, reduce German morale, and "de-house" the German civilian population.[204]
